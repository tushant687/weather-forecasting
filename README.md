# weather-forecasting 
here we use the three libraries 
(i) Requests Library Documentation
Install: Run pip install requests to install the requests library.
Fetch Weather Data: Use response = requests.get("API_URL") to fetch and process weather data from a weather API.
(ii) Tkinter Documentation
Install Tkinter: Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python. You can start using it without any additional installation. However, if you encounter any issues, you can install it using:
pip install tk
Tkinter is used for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. It allows you to build windows, dialogs, and interactive elements like buttons and labels for your applications.
(iii) MessageBox Documentation (Tkinter)
Tkinter's messagebox module is used to create different types of message boxes in a Tkinter GUI. Common functions include showinfo(), showwarning(), showerror(), askquestion(), askokcancel(), and askyesno(), which display informational, warning, error messages, and dialog boxes, respectively.

These references provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and guides for utilizing the 
Python Requests library for API requests, building graphical user interfaces using Tkinter, and 
displaying message boxes. Additionally, they offer valuable resources for machine learning and 
deep learning techniques, including scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, which are relevant 
for developing weather forecasting models.
